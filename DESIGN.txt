C-Shell
Jerry Lei

Features:
 Forks to execute commands.
 Runs infinitely many commands separated by ';'.
 Can redirect '>', '<'.
 Can do one pipe, once.

Attempted:
 Not end the shell loop in pipe.
 Attempted >>, but segfault when appending.
 When redirecting, creates an executable file.

Bugs:
 Running a pipe command will kill the entire shell (command will return).

========void what_to_do(char * args[]);
	Input: Args separated by ' '
	Purpose: Checks if any of the args meet a special case
	If it does, redirects to the specific location
	If it doesn't, just runs args through regular_commands

========void regular_commands(char * args[]);
	Input: Args separated by ' '
	Purpose: Forks and executes command'

========void multiple_commands(char *args[]);
	Input: Args separated by ' '
	Purpose: Separates by ';' and runs regular_commands on separated arrays

========void change_directory(char *args[]);
	Input: Args separated by ' '
	Purpose: chdir into args[1]. If args[0] is NULL, goes to HOME

========void simple_redirection(char *args[]);
	Input: Args separated by ' '
	Purpose: checks if '>' or '<' and does one redirection appropriately

========void simple_piping(char *args[]);
	Input: Args separated by ' '
	Purpose: Divides args before and after '|' and pipes
	DOESN'T FUNCTION PROPERLY. CUTS OFF AFTER ONE RUN.
